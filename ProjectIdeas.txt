============================
Project: STE StyleSet Editor
============================
  - Also, display style coverage areas in STE 
	(=>select a StyleSet to edit)
	Zebra striping?
	Transparent color differs from text hilight so hilight shows through
  - Display Styles in StyleSet; add/delete style
  - Font Pallet (=> FontMorphs)
  - 

================================
Project: Morphic Property Editor
================================
  - Used to display/edit public/shown Morphic Properties
	=> {mutable|immutable} {hidden|shown} ; default is hidden
  - {hidden} props are considered private
  - These MetaProperties are shared and immutable
	+ MetaProperties are inherited & apply to all instance of a class
  - Used to edit STE Character and Paragraph Styles (=> Morphs for these)
  - Drop a CharacterStyle on a ParagraphStyle to set those properties (subset)
  - Property edits Undoable (old values in instance properties)
	=> fooInst oldPropValueFor: #prop
  - PropertyEditor differs from Object Explorer/Inspector
	+ Properties meant to be edited by user
	  => {hidden|shown}
	+ DragNDrop of properties (also, drop SignMorph, ColorSwatch ..)
  - Property value edit affordance different depending on case
	+ Pallet (large range of discrete choices)
	+ Menu Select (small range of discrete choices) [Icons shown in Menu]
	+ FillIn (Text/Symbol/Number/Point/Range/..)
	+ Workspace (general purpose object eval: 
		<obj> setProperty: #prop toValue: <fillInExpression>)

Prototype: Dict of (Class -> MetaPropSet x cache)
  cache is used for inherited metaProps
